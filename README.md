# DuckChessZero

This is an engine + analysis interface for duck chess that runs entirely in the browser, with the networks trained with tabula rasa self-play, like AlphaZero.

Live version: [https://peter.website/duck-chess](https://peter.website/duck-chess)

The engine uses TensorFlow.js to perform inference, and a WASM backend written in Rust for MCTS.

## Building

Currently everything is a big mess, but I can clean up the code at some point if folks want to modify it.
But I'm going to leave it as a massive mess until someone expresses interest.

## Bug reports / improvements
